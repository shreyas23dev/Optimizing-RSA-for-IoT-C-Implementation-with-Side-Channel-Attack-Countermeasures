# Optimizing-RSA-for-IoT-C-Implementation-with-Side-Channel-Attack-Countermeasures
### This project presents a secure and optimized RSA cryptographic algorithm implementation in the C programming language, focused on mitigating side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks exploit physical leakages like timing, power consumption, or     cache access patterns to extract sensitive data such as private keys. These vulnerabilities are especially critical in cryptographic devices and resource-constrained environments like IoT systems.

## This project focuses on enhancing traditional RSA cryptography by:

  >Implementing constant-time algorithms to reduce timing attack vulnerabilities,

  >Using masking and randomized exponentiation to obfuscate sensitive operations,

  >Improving efficiency for resource-constrained environments,

  >Benchmarking performance against higher-level languages (Python, Java).
